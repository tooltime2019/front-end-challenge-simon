## Notes

- You can use any JS frameworks or VanillaJS.
- You can use starter projects such as [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
- Commit all changes to a Git repository and follow [good commit message practice](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- Don't spend more than 6 hours.
- Focus on good application structure, not a hacky solution.
- Your solution needs to be responsive, it should work on small and large screens.
- Make sure there's a README with instructions on how to build and run the application.

When you're done, send us the Git repo. We will then review your submission.
